#![allow(unused)]

//! Diagnostics rendering and fixits.
//!
//! Most of the diagnostics originate from the dark depth of the compiler, and
//! are originally expressed in term of IR. When we emit the diagnostic, we are
//! usually not in the position to decide how to best "render" it in terms of
//! user-authored source code. We are especially not in the position to offer
//! fixits, as the compiler completely lacks the infrastructure to edit the
//! source code.
//!
//! Instead, we "bubble up" raw, structured diagnostics until the `hir` crate,
//! where we "cook" them so that each diagnostic is formulated in terms of `hir`
//! types. Well, at least that's the aspiration, the "cooking" is somewhat
//! ad-hoc at the moment. Anyways, we get a bunch of ide-friendly diagnostic
//! structs from hir, and we want to render them to unified serializable
//! representation (span, level, message) here. If we can, we also provide
//! fixits. By the way, that's why we want to keep diagnostics structured
//! internally -- so that we have all the info to make fixes.
//!
//! We have one "handler" module per diagnostic code. Such a module contains
//! rendering, optional fixes and tests. It's OK if some low-level compiler
//! functionality ends up being tested via a diagnostic.
//!
//! There are also a couple of ad-hoc diagnostics implemented directly here, we
//! don't yet have a great pattern for how to do them properly.
